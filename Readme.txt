This implementation preprocesses images to simulate low-resolution inputs, builds the method(s) architecture, and trains the model using synthetic data. Replace example_image.jpg with your image and ensure the necessary libraries are installed (tensorflow, skimage, etc.). Let me know if you need further refinements or additional methods!
